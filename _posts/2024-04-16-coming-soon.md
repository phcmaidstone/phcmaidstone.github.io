We're delighted to announce Potter's House will be coming to Maidstone within the next year.  We're looking forward to being part of the community and meeting you all!

At the present time, we don't have an exact date when we'll be opening our doors to the community, but we're working hard to put everything in place.

## A Church is about it's people

We believe a church isn't about the building, or even the services but about the people it serves.  Our ethos is to love God, love people and serve others.

> And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.
> *Hebrews 10:24-25 NKJV*

We'd be delighted to hear from you, are happy to answer any questions and are here to help!
