                    <h3>Summary</h3>

                    <p>
			Encountering Jesus fills us with Hope! The Shepherds were visited by the angel on a regular day whilst carrying out their regular job and respond to the angels message with faith, leaving their flocks to seek the newborn Saviour.
			The Shepherds take journey from fear, to faith, to joy reminding us we should overcome our fears, trust God’s promises, step out in faith, and let the joy of encountering Jesus fill us with hope that transforms our ever day lives.

                    <h3>Scriptures</h3>

					<h4>Luke 2:8-20 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>8</strong> Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
							<strong>9</strong> And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid. 
							<br/>
							<strong>10</strong> Then the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. 11 For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
							<strong>11</strong> For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 
							<strong>12</strong> And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.”
							<strong>13</strong> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:
							<br/>														
							<strong>14</strong> “Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!”
							<br/>														
							<strong>15</strong> So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, “Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.”
							<br/>
							<strong>16</strong> And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger.
							<strong>17</strong> Now when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.
							<strong>18</strong> And all those who heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
							<strong>19</strong> But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.
							<br/>
 							<strong>20</strong> Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.
						</blockquote>												
					</p>	

					<h4>Luke 1:76-79 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>76</strong> “And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest; For you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,
							<strong>77</strong> To give knowledge of salvation to His people By the remission of their sins,
							<strong>78</strong> Through the tender mercy of our God, With which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;
							<strong>79</strong> To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, To guide our feet into the way of peace.”
						</blockquote>
					</p>
										
					<h4>Psalm 23:1 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>1</strong> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
						</blockquote>
					</p>

					<h4>1 Samuel 17:34:35 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>34</strong> But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock,
							<strong>35</strong> I went out after it and struck it, and delivered the lamb from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught it by its beard, and struck and killed it.
						</blockquote>
					</p>

					<h4>Malachi 3:1 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>1</strong> > “Behold, I send My messenger, And he will prepare the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, Will suddenly come to His temple, Even the Messenger of the covenant, In whom you delight. Behold, He is coming,” Says the Lord of hosts.
						</blockquote>
					</p>	

					<h4>Psalm 42:10 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>10</strong> Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!
						</blockquote>
					</p>		

					<h4>Romans 8:24-25 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>24</strong> For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?
							<strong>25</strong> But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.
						</blockquote>
					</p>												

					<h4>John 10:11 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>11</strong> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.
						</blockquote>
					</p>											


					<h4>Luke 15:4-7 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>4</strong> “What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? 
							<strong>5</strong> And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
							<br/>
							<strong>6</strong> And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’
							<strong>7</strong> I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.
