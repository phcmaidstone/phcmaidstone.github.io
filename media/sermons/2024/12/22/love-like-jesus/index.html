                    <h3>Summary</h3>

                    <p>
			To Love Like Jesus is to embrace a life marked by compassion, sacrifice, and action. Jesus’ love was unconditional, extending to the outcast, the sinner, and even His enemies. He showed His love through service, teaching, and ultimately laying down His life on the cross. This love wasn’t passive but transformative, drawing people closer to God. As we live out the Christmas story, we are called to reflect His love daily—seeking to grow, serve, and forgive, just as He did. Loving like Jesus means stepping out of our comfort zones to be present, active, and intentional in the lives of others.

                    <h3>Scriptures</h3>

					<h4>Matthew 1:18-21; 24-25 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>18</strong> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. 
							<strong>19</strong> Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly. 
							<br/>
							<strong>20</strong> But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
							<strong>21</strong> And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”
							<br/>
              <br/>
							<strong>24</strong> Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife
              <strong>25</strong> and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name Jesus.
						</blockquote>												
					</p>	

					<h4>John 15:13 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>13</strong> Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.
						</blockquote>
					</p>
										
					<h4>Mark 10:45 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>45</strong> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.
						</blockquote>
					</p>

					<h4>1 John 3:16-18 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>16</strong> By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
							<strong>17</strong> But whoever has this world’s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?
              <strong>18</strong> My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.
						</blockquote>
					</p>

					<h4>Ephesians 5:2 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>2</strong> And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.
						</blockquote>
					</p>	

					<h4>Romans 5:8 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>8</strong> But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
						</blockquote>
					</p>	   

					<h4>John 3:16-17 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>16</strong> For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
              <strong>17</strong> For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.
						</blockquote>
					</p>	  

					<h4>Ephesians 2:4-5 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>4</strong> But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,
              <strong>5</strong> even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),
						</blockquote>
					</p>	     

					<h4>Philippians 2:5-7 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>5</strong> Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,
              <strong>6</strong> who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God,
              <strong>7</strong> but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.
						</blockquote>
					</p>	        

                    					<h4>1 John 4:19 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>19</strong> We love Him because He first loved us.
						</blockquote>
					</p>	  

                    					<h4>1 John 4:9-11 NKJV</h4>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							<strong>9</strong> In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.
              <strong>10</strong> In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 
              <strong>11</strong> Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
						</blockquote>
