Our Sunday services will begin with a few songs then our Pastor will share a relevant message for about 30 minutes. At the end of Sunday Worship, there is always a chance to respond to the presence of God (some refer to it as an altar call), but you will never be pressured by anyone to do so. People are always available to pray or talk with you at any time that you would like.
