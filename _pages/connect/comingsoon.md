Thank you for responding to our flyer!

Potters House Church Maidstone will be opening during 2024!  We do not have a precise date for our church services at this time, but we encourage you to bookmark this page, follow us on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/@phcmaidstone) or [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@phcmaidstone) where we'll be keeping you up to date on progress.

We will soon be starting in-person [Bible Study Classes](/bible-study/), hosting weekly online [Prayer Meetings](/events/) and attending [Community Events](/events/).  If you'd like to be kept up to date on our progress, join a bible study or prayer meeting, ask us to attend your event - or anything at all - please complete the form below or [drop us an email](mailto:hello@phcmaidstone.co.uk).
