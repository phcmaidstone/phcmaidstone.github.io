Thank you for responding to our flyer!

Potters House Church Maidstone will be opening during 2024!  We do not have a precise date for our church services at this time, but we encourage you do bookmark this page, follow us on Instagram or YouTube where we'll be keeping you up to date on progress.

We will soon be starting in-person Bible Study Classes, hosting weekly online Prayer Meetings and attending community events.  If you'd like to join us, or ask us to attend your event, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@phcmaidstone.co.uk).
