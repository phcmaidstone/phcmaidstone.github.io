> *I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly*
> **John 10:10**

We passionately believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit to change lives. Jesus loves you, and wants you to live an abundant life style. He has changed our lives, and He can do the same for you!

Through our in-person [Bible Study Classes](/bible-study/), weekly online [Prayer Meetings](/events/) and attending [Community Events](/events/), we aim to share the gospel and show how the teachings of Jesus Christ can bring a life full of hope, love and peace.

If you'd like to be kept up to date on our progress as we approach our exciting launch, join a bible study class or prayer meeting, ask us to attend your local event - or just to say Hi! - please complete the form below or [drop us an email](mailto:hello@phcmaidstone.co.uk).
