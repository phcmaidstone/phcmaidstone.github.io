## Our Beliefs

We believe in salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ and not of works (Ephesians 2:8). We believe that no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless they are born again (John 3:5-8) and that all who accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour are declared righteous by God (Hebrew 10:19-25). All born again believers in Jesus Christ should be baptised (Mark 16:16). Every born again believer needs to show evidence of salvation from sin by pursuing a Godly life and exhibiting fruit of a life being lived for Jesus Christ.
